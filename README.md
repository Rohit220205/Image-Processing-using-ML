#  Image Preprocessing and Classification Pipeline

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for image preprocessing and classification using traditional machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to prepare images through various transformation techniques and train models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and CNN for classification tasks.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** - image handling and manipulation
- **Pillow (PIL)** - image conversion and processing
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** - data visualization
- **scikit-image** - preprocessing utilities
- **scikit-learn** - classical ML models and metrics
- **Keras** (TensorFlow backend) - deep learning (CNN)
- **NumPy, Pandas** - numerical and tabular data handling

---

##  Features

- Image loading and preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, morphological operations)
- Feature extraction using HOG
- Train/test split and data preparation
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - SVM (with grid search tuning)
  - Random Forest
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

---



##  Example Results

After training the models, the notebook provides various evaluation metrics and visualizations. Some expected output includes:

- Classification report
- Confusion matrix heatmaps
- CNN architecture summary
- Training vs. validation accuracy/loss graphs

---

##  Future Improvements

- Add support for more image transformations (e.g., histogram equalization)
- Augment the dataset with image flipping, rotation, etc.
- Save trained models for inference
- Build a small web interface using Streamlit or Flask
